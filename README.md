# ST Microcontroller Learning

This is a collection of examples and projects for STM32 microcontrollers. Code is currently available for the STM32F401C discovery model.

This code relies on V1.4.0 of ST's STM32Cube software available [here](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1743/LN1897/PF259243).  The `Drivers` portion has been extracted to `st-microcontroller-learning/drivers`.
